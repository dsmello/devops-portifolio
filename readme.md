# The DevOps portifolio

This is a portifolio that I created to show my skills in DevOps. Because most of my work is private, I decided to create this portifolio to show my skills.

## Description

This portifolio is divided in two parts: projects and technologies. In the projects section, I show some projects that I created to learn and practice some technologies. In the technologies section, I show some technologies that I used in my projects.
